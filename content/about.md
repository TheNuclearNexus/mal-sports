title: About Mallory Agner
---

Hi! I'm a Sport and Recreation Management major at James Madison University, graduating May 17th, 2025, with minors in General Business and Honors Interdisciplinary Studies. My passion lies at the intersection of athletics, communication, and mental health advocacy, and I've built a diverse portfolio of hands-on experiences across collegiate sports, major events, and nonprofit leadership.

Currently, I serve as a student worker with JMU Athletic Communications, where I manage **live game updates, operate scoreboards, and collaborate with coaches and media** to deliver real-time statistics across a wide range of sports including football, volleyball, field hockey, soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, and lacrosse. I’ve also worked with **ESPN College GameDay, the NCAA Final Four, and Marymount University Athletics**, gaining invaluable insight into the operational and promotional side of sports media.

Beyond athletics, **I'm deeply committed to mental health advocacy**. I founded the James Madison University chapter of Morgan’s Message, a national organization focused on destigmatizing mental health in the student-athlete community. As Chapter President, I lead events, manage fundraising efforts, and help foster a culture of support and openness on campus.

I'm skilled in tools such as **Adobe Creative Suite, Canva, Sidearm Sports, Statcrew, and DAKTRONICS**, and I'm comfortable managing social media across platforms such as **Instagram, X, TikTok, YouTube, and mor**e.

I thrive in dynamic, team-oriented environments where I can communicate, connect, and create meaningful impact.

It is with great pleasure and pride that I offer my fervent support of Mallory Agner. Through her work with Morgan’s Message as a campus Ambassador at James Madison University, I  have witnessed first-hand her efforts to not only start the Morgan’s Message Education  Program but lead its growth into a sustainable organization that is having a direct impact on  the members of her community. 

Morgan’s Message is approaching its fifth year in existence, and we have close to 7000  Ambassadors on over 1900 high school and college campuses. Mallory is a standout. Her  dedication to the importance of mental health, spreading awareness and eliminating the  stigma surrounding it is truly inspirational. She has led numerous initiatives among her  peers and has reached her broader community by filling the gap between the mental health  resources on JMU’s campus and the students. 
As President of the JMU chapter, and in just one year, Mallory was responsible for hosting  monthly meetings, successfully organized several dedication games and activities, and grew club membership from 0 to 218. In addition to her ambassador responsibilities, she  has organized fundraisers and represented Morgan’s Message in the planning process for a national youth lacrosse tournament. Before graduating, she hosted interviews and  elections for the following year’s Executive Board of the JMU chapter. She is dependable,  passionate and works tirelessly for the good of those around her.  

Her willingness to share her own experiences and revealing her vulnerabilities has given  many mental health advocates in her community the comfort to share their own and in  some circumstances get the professional mental health they desired. This is the  cornerstone of Morgan’s Message. 

Mallory represents everything Morgan’s Message encompasses. We are deeply  appreciative and proud of the work she has done in such a short period of time and are  excited to see her flourish in the next chapter of her life. I have no doubt she will continue to succeed as her passion and dedication to anything she sets out to accomplish is what  drives her ambition.  

Mallory would be an extra-ordinary asset to any organization lucky enough to have her. As a  leader on and off campus, Mallory’s actions are above and beyond her words. 

Sincerely, 

Dona F. Rodgers

Mother of Morgan, Co-Founder, President, Morgan’s Message, Inc.
