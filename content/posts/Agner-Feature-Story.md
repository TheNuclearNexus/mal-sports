For Meghan, sports have never been just a pastime — they’ve been a guiding force and a career compass. From her earliest days, growing up in New York with her mom’s love of local teams, Meghan’s path has always been shaped by athletics. “I grew up with sports,” she reflects. “It was part of my family, part of our conversations, part of who I was.”

Throughout middle and high school, that love grew. She wasn’t just playing sports — she was writing about them, broadcasting games, and finding ways to be part of the story. Those experiences laid the foundation for a journey that would eventually take her through two distinctive and transformative chapters: the University of Central Florida and James Madison University. Each with different shades of gold, they brought her along this path towards a career in athletic communications.

***UCF: Black and Gold***  
After transferring to UCF in her sophomore year, Meghan found herself at a crossroads. She initially applied for a position in the athletic communications department as a way to get closer to broadcasting and sideline reporting. What she didn’t expect was that this role would open the door to an entirely new career.

“UCF gave me the reins to find myself,” she explains. “It was the first time I felt like I could really make a direct impact on student-athletes.”

UCF wasn’t just a school for Meghan; it was where she found her closest friends through her sorority, her sideline, and her office. She was trusted to take initiative, lead, and learn. She threw herself into every opportunity, from day-to-day operations to hosting major events. One of the defining moments came when UCF hosted and won a regional championship game. Meghan was in the thick of it—not just as a student worker, but as someone operating like an SID.  
The adrenaline, combined with the ability to elevate student-athlete stories, solidified her passion. “I loved it,” she recalls. “I realized this wasn’t just a way to broadcasting; this was something I could build a future around.”

***JMU: Purple and Gold***  
The black was traded in for purple, and Meghan kept the gold. After graduating from UCF, she found herself moving up the East Coast to Harrisonburg, VA, at James Madison University.  
“JMU found me, and I found JMU,” she said with a smile.  
At JMU, Meghan took on a dual-sport role — serving as secondary contact for football and primary contact for softball. It was a demanding schedule, but it was precisely the kind of challenge she craved. Both programs have been constantly on the rise and in the spotlight, offering her the chance to grow alongside them.

“Being with sports that are always in the limelight showed me I could handle anything,” Meghan says. “I’ve done this, and now I know I can go do anything else.”  
Her time in Harrisonburg was marked by rapid growth. She learned the rhythms of mid-major college football while managing the unique dynamics of a successful softball program. The exposure was invaluable, but what stood out most was the impact she was able to make.

“When you’re part of programs like that, you see how your work helps shape how student-athletes are seen and supported,” she explains. “The want to be successful leads you to be successful.”

***Looking Ahead: Starting the Next Gold***  
She’s not slowing down. In five years, she envisions herself stepping into a leadership role—potentially running her own department. She’s determined to keep pushing forward, always searching for the next gold.

“If you set your goals to be obtainable, you’ll reach them and stop” she says. 

It goes beyond titles. She wants to shape how athletic communications supports student-athletes in an ever-changing environment. Whether through social media strategy, branding, or administrative leadership, Meghan’s vision is clear: to lead and to make an impact.

If you’re lucky enough to be one of Meghan’s students, you know that she wants the best for the next generation of workers as much as her student-athletes. Meghan’s message is straightforward: stay humble, stay resilient, and keep your eyes open for that one ‘yes’.”

“We are never too big for the small stuff,” she emphasizes. “Our titles may be different, but at the end of the day, we’re all on one team.”  
She’s also realistic about the challenges of the field. “It’s okay not to be liked everywhere,” she says. “You have to be willing to speak up for what’s right. And don’t undermine yourself, the job is hard enough… All you need is one yes.”

***Reaching for Gold***  
More than anything, Meghan believes in people. She’s passionate about ensuring that student-athletes feel seen, heard, and cared for—not just as athletes, but as individuals.  
“It doesn’t matter if this is a stepping stone,” she says. “What matters is how you show you care while you’re here.”

She emphasizes education and support that extends beyond the playing field. Meghan sees her role as helping student-athletes prepare for the real world, whether that means building communication skills, navigating the media, or being treated like humans.  
“Don’t shut them down…help them learn about us,” she says. “We want people to know that we care.”

From New York roots to UCF’s empowering environment, from JMU’s high-profile programs to her future aspirations, Meghan Kalenborn’s story is one of continuously reaching for gold—not just in her school’s colors, but in herself, for the student-athletes and teams she serves.

Meghan’s journey is coming to a close at JMU. Her next steps have not been announced yet, but I can say that she is continuing her pattern and her next school’s colors…carry on the gold.
